# harmonic_visualisation
This python program reads out a randomised list of chords for the musician to identify on his instrument.


**HOW TO USE**

1. Download the repository
2. Open Piano Trainer - HV.csv and edit it to your liking. Key and Chord Type will determine the Chords that you want to train. Frequency determines the number of times that each chord will appear in the randomised list.
3. Open hv.py and input the variables:
  - (a) The File Path of PIano Trainer - HV.csv on your computer
  - (b) The desired training time in seconds. The program will automatically cut when the training time is reached.
4. Run the program. The program will ask for your desired difficulty level. This is the length of pause between the reading of each chord. Hence, the lower the number the greater the difficulty.
